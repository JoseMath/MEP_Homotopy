%DEMO_FLUTTER1  Aerolastic flutter as a multiparameter eigenvalue problem
%
% This example computes the flutter point for the section model with 
% unsteady aerodynamics, where the Theodorsen function is approximated by 
% the Jones approximation. The example is from
% 
% Arion Pons: Aerolastic flutter as a multiparameter eigenvalue problem,
% MSc thesis, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of 
% Canterbury, 2015.
% 
% The main idea is: we have a complex matrix value function A(hi,p), where
% hi and p are complex and real parameter, respectively. We want to find a 
% p such that the eigenvalue hi has zero imaginary part. We take the 
% adjungate of the equation, assume that hi and p are real, and thus obtain 
% a nonlinear two-parameter eigenvalue problem. We linearize it into a
% polynomial two-parameter eigenvalue problem and solve it. From the 
% obtained solution we extract eigenvalues (hi,p) where both hi and p are 
% real, this is the solution of the original problem. For more details, see
% the above MSc thesis.
% 
% The particular example uses equation (2.3.21) from page 25, the results 
% in the (kappa, chi) form agree with Figure 4.15 from page 91.
%
% The flutter point is kappa = 0.8077 and chi = 0.2557
